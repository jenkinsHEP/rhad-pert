====================

runal.f: pause command removed

r34.f updated: exact alpha_s^4 corrections included for the
               the (m^2/s)^0 and (m^2/s)^1 terms. 

The (m^2/s)^1 corrections where the outer quark is massless are neglected
at order alpha_s^4. The corresponding corrections at order alpha_s^3
are already included in version 1.00.
